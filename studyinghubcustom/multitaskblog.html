For the first half of my highschool career, my study/work time would be shared with Netflix, YouTube, or Facebook, I was The Multitasker Master, but was that really the right choice? It was my afterschool ritual to grab a snack, and complete my homework or study whilst watching TV shows, but now as a rising sophomore in college, as I look back, it wasn’t the right choice. If your mindset is where mine was as a freshman or sophomore, you’re probably thinking, “How bad could multitasking be? Does it even make a difference?” Let me tell you: it does.
<br>
<br>
<br>
TLDR: Don’t try to multitask. Just FOCUS and SAVE TIME.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Generally, in freshman and sophomore year, all my time afterschool was used to finish my homework. I didn’t have time to read the books I wanted or spend more time on the subjects that I was struggling with. All I’d do is complain that my teachers would give too much homework. And listen, they did give A LOT of homework, but I spent WAY more time than I should’ve because I was watching TV shows, YouTube videos, and complaining to my friends through Facebook Messenger (we’ve all been there). But going into junior year of highschool, I knew I had to make changes, so I decided to switch my work method. I’d come home, eat a quick snack, and start my homework right away with no shows, social media, or distractions, with maybe 5 minute breaks in between to recharge my brain. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
AND LEMME TELL YOU. I saved so much time. After three to four hours of hard work and focus, and I’d be done. I’d have more time to play the piano, find more practice problems to do online, and just things I like to do in general. This doesn’t just apply for high schoolers, it’s the same for college students. Focus during lectures, finish your homework as soon as you can without the distractions, so that you have more time to do more things, and you’ll get SUCCESS. 
<br>

(There are a lot of articles that explain the detriments of multitasking, so don’t just take my word!)
