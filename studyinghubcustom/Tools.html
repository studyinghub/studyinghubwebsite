   <div class = "preface"><h3 class = "prefacetext">These are all apps that I currently use, most on a daily basis.<br> I will continue to add more tools as I come across them!</h3></div>
 
  <div class="zone grid-wrapper"> 
    <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Evernote</h2><img class = "cover" src="evernote.jpg"><p class = "boxtext"> Studying can sometimes cover several different platforms, but with Evernote all of your notes, information, and research can be collaborated together in one place. Evernote can be used in a multitude of ways: keeping research paper information in order, organizing presentation notes, creating study guides off of in-class note taking, not to mention everyday non-school related tasks, too.</div>
     <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Forest</h2><img class = "cover" src="forest900.png"><p class = "boxtext" style="padding-top: 20px">	One of my favorite apps to use while studying, this app uses a timer to help you concentrate on the task at hand, you "plant" a seed when you press start, if you leave the app before time is up, the tree you planted in the beginning dies. This makes it so you do not go on social media, and text others while you study! </div>
    <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Quizlet</h2><img class = "cover" src="quizlet.gif"><p class = "boxtext" style="padding-top: 30px">One of the most famous studying tools to have ever been created, I have been using quizlet and its flashcard/studying features to lock in certain concepts and to also memorize thousands of words. If you have never used quizlet, I highly reccomend you give it a try!</div>
     <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Blinkist</h2><img class = "cover" src="blinkist.png"><p class = "boxtext"> With more than a thousand non-fiction books transformed into the essence required to understand a book, you’ll be able to save lots of time and gain even more knowledge. You’ll get to read one free pre-selected book per day, or you can pay a yearly affordable price to get many more. It takes only 15 minutes to get through the key points of a wide range of books! </div>
     <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Trello</h2><img class = "cover" src="Trello.png"><p class = "boxtext" style="margin-top: 30px">Trello is a terrific tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. But Trello isn't just for work. You can use it to organize just about anything, perhaps your entire life. I use this everyday!</div>
    <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Wolfram Alpha</h2><img class = "cover" src="wolfram.jpg" ><p class = "boxtext" style="padding-top: 20px">If your someone who hates math like me, this app is a must download. Wolfram will solve almost any math problem you throw at it, using its sophisticated algorithms. Wolfram has saved my high school career multiple times, and hopefully it will help you as well!</div>
     <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">Google Calendar</h2><img class = "cover" src="calendar.png"><p class = "boxtext">I use Google Calendar to schedule all my plans and events. You can use it on devices, and it can even set up alerts. The user interface is very clean and simple to use. If you are looking to organize your life, I highly reccomend you start using Google Calendar!</div>
     <div class="box zone"><h2 style="letter-spacing: 2px">GoConqr</h2><img class = "cover" src="goconqr.jpg"><p class = "boxtext">GoConqr is a personal learning environment that allows students to create, discover and share learning resources. Goconqr includes study tools to create Mind Maps, Flashcards, Notes and Quizzes. If your overwhelmed or underwhelmed with information, this app is perfect for organizing and learning new concepts and ideas! </div>
