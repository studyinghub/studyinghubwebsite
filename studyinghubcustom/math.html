Interesting, you’ve stumbled along yet another blog post to read about the secrets on how you can [possibly] ace your next calculus exam. (When in actual fact your teacher told you that the only POSSIBLE way to master mathematics is by doing practice problems). Bold move for reading this despite your teacher’s “advice”, bold. You may be thinking already after a few lines of this post, “are you sure reading a blog post will help increase my understanding of mathematics?” My honest answer to that question is --insert dramatic drum roll-- yes. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tldr; your teacher/professor isn’t wrong but they’re also not completely right. ESPECIALLY if you are currently a high school/middle school student. All throughout my years of high school I’ve probably solved every single possible practice problem provided by the front page of google results and of course my “completely necessary” textbooks. However, looking back I now know that I knew absolutely NOTHING about math. Sure I aced every single test, exam, quiz (until I hit AP Calculus AB/BC *insert crying pepe the frog*) but during my first year of college I realized that the emphasis on mastering mathematics should not solely be placed on computations. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if you don’t really care about math beyond the grades then you may exit this post (but thank you so much for reading haha). Doing all the practice problems and going over notes will indeed get you that A on the exam. Just do a LOT of them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, for you math geeks here you go~
<br>
<br>
<br>
Emphasis should be divided half on theory and half on the dreary computations that we all have had ENOUGH of. That is the key to really understanding math. Here’s an equation for you:
Understand Math = Study less = Better grades in half the time
<br>
<br>
<br>
Screw the teachers, just do it yourself. Do the practice problems you’re given yeah but if you are serious about learning mathematics, it’s gonna take far more than just knowing how to follow an algorithm. Watch theoretical videos on why a problem even exists rather than just knowing how to compute a problem. Thanks for reading!
