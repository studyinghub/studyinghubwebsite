Growing up I’ve heard the same stereotype probably close to a thousand times. “Ray, you’re so good at math because you’re Korean you’re so lucky.” Well, yes and no. I was indeed above average in almost all of my previous mathematics courses, but I mean what about the humanities courses I’ve taken? What about AP Literature, AP US History, AP Government & Politics, …? These courses have taught me how to think outside the box. In fact, these courses probably made me a better at the STEM classes that I’ve taken so far.
<br>
<br>
<br>
TLDR; (for you lazy readers haha) Humanities allows you to analyze things with different goggles which can allow you to advance your scientific, mathematical, engineerical, etc. skills. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a computer science major I know what it means to think outside the box. When I get stuck on a practice problem pertaining to data structures and algorithms or when I’m stuck on an incredibly tedious integral for my math requirements, there are often times when it is absolutely essential for me to think outside of the basic “Asians are good at math” box. Let me show you how the humanities have guided me in this process.
<br>
<br>
<br>
For starters, every subject in the world requires some reading and writing. In fact, you’ll come to see that even math can be mistaken for humanities courses by confused college students who partied far too hard the previous night. (yes this was a joke, you may laugh *insert Kawaii Leonard laugh*) The amount of reading that I’ve done in APUSH and AP GOPO, paired with the strategies of analyzing text in AP Lit has transferred over to my STEM skills in, well, exactly that way. I now KNOW how to analyze things! *boom* 
<br>
<br>
<br>
So what’re you waiting for? Go register for Global Awareness, Musics of the World, Art History, whatever it is! You will surely NOT regret it. (I mean, if you go to Rutgers like myself you kinda have to anyways). You will quickly see that your analytical skills will increase a few-fold and well, in the real world writing is crucial in landing first internships, jobs, new positions. Thanks for reading.
